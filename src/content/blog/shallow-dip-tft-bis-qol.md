description: "Commenting on recent system changes in TFT's set 12"
---

TFT Set 12, Magic ‚Äòn Mayhem is out on the PBE! Accordingly, with the release of a new set, Riot has made some system changes, and a few with regards to unit stats have stood out to me: the new mana banking system and the inclusion of damage multipliers and resistance in the unit overview. These are both somewhat subtle but very satisfying changes to see, and I wanted to do a little glazing because I need to wet my palate before proceeding to complain in a few patches.

## Table of contents

## Mana banking
A little while ago, [I wrote a bit regarding mana design in TFT](/posts/shallow-dip-tft-units-and-mana-design). In the essay, I discussed the overall design of mana pools in Set 11, and how they centered around specific sub archetypes, in large part as a consequence of the existing mana system. Ever since the release of TFT, mana has had a pretty standard set of rules. 
1. Units have some number of starting and maximum mana.
2. Units gain 10 mana per auto attack. They also gain X% of pre-mitigation damage and Y% of post-mitigation damage as mana. They also periodically gain mana from items, augments, or traits.
3. When a unit‚Äôs current mana surpasses the maximum mana, their mana is set to 0, they are locked out of gaining mana for a set amount of time, and they cast their spell.

In Set 12, this has been changed. Instead of setting mana to 0, units now ‚Äúbank‚Äù any excess mana for after the cast. Previously, all excess mana would be completely wasted and your unit‚Äôs efforts would be in vain, but now mana losslessly transitions into your unit‚Äôs next spell. Written out again, the rules would look like this:
1. Units have some number of starting and maximum mana.
2. Units gain 10 mana per auto attack. They also gain X% of pre-mitigation damage and Y% of post-mitigation damage as mana. They also periodically gain mana from items, augments, or traits.
3. When a unit‚Äôs current mana surpasses the maximum mana, their mana is set to $Current Mana - Max Mana$, they are locked out of gaining mana for a set amount of time, and they cast their spell.

~~Despite it rendering much of my previous code and analysis useless,~~ this is a great change! It does a few good things for the game.
### Decreases the importance of knowing weird breakpoints
#### Items
The original system was very swingy around thresholds. Previously, excess mana was actively detrimental: you were investing resources into a system that wouldn‚Äôt handle overflow, and as such excess mana went to waste. It created a few weird scenarios that were unintuitive to players, especially those who didn‚Äôt look at stats websites to figure out best in slot (BIS). Sure, it was obvious that you should itemize a unit with 30 max mana using Blue Buff, but how about 40? Okay, what about 50? And 45? In each of these cases, there was a technically correct but rather unintuitive answer (if you‚Äôre curious, it‚Äôs Blue Buff + Shojin, Blue Buff, Shojin). TFT might lean on statistics outside of the game, but on the Convergence it‚Äôs mostly a game of intuition and experience. Math really shouldn‚Äôt be the first topic on your mind when you‚Äôre already juggling so many other thoughts during your frantic 4-2 rolldown.

Let me address a few caveats before moving on.
- Yes, itemization at the top level has never been about getting exactly BIS for all your units, and it‚Äôs technically correct to mostly ignore your perfect items and instead play for acceptable slams to save HP. 
- Yes, the time until first cast matters more than later casts, especially if a unit has a high impact spell, so breakpoints still exist in a sense. 
- No, you‚Äôd rarely overcap by that much: we‚Äôre talking 5, maybe 10 mana you‚Äôre wasting per cast if you‚Äôre extra unlucky. 

Even with all of those in mind, there still exists a non-trivial power difference between mana options that forces commitment in an unsatisfying way. Riot Mort himself has said that he wants to get rid of mana items [link], and I personally agree with him, but the stopgap is to make them less restrictive first. 
#### Traits
The change to mana banking also significantly affects another mana generation source: traits. There have been a number of mana-generating traits throughout TFT‚Äôs life: Invoker, Coven, A.D.M.I.N., Scholar, etc. Units with this class are intended to cast repeatedly, and their kits are designed accordingly. However, unbeknownst to newer players, building mana generation items for these champions was often a trap. With some unfortunate timing, the mana generated by these traits might suddenly overcap a unit, leading to a significant amount of wasted mana.

> the shojin doesn‚Äôt do anything, i honestly thought it would

The graph above is exaggerated to favor my argument for comedic effect, but the point remains. Mana banking removes this issue entirely: invoker units are allowed to have smaller maximum mana pools and use mana items without their effects completely going to waste. Here‚Äôs what that looks like:

</div>

> the üò≥ emoji doesn‚Äôt show correctly on matplot saj

This graph is kinda ass for clarity, but it does simulate what happens. I counted the casts so you didn‚Äôt have to.

| Champion Combination   | Number of Casts |
| -------- | ------- |
| Shojin 6 Invoker Lillia (Banked) | 8 |
| Shojin 6 Invoker Lillia (Reset) | 6 |
| Naked 6 Invoker Lillia (Banked) | 7 |
| Naked 6 Invoker Lillia (Reset) | 6 |

Notably, even correctly itemized Lillia gets a buff here! If I had to guess, mana items are still low priority on Invoker-type units, but at least you‚Äôre not actively wasting an item slot. I‚Äôd consider that a positive change.
### Gives the balance team a less sensitive lever to tune units
There‚Äôs an additional benefit that‚Äôs more dev sided. Let‚Äôs illustrate it with an example!

Let‚Äôs say that Zoe (Set 11), a unit with a maximum mana of 60 that commonly builds Shojin, is currently dominating the meta. You‚Äôre on the Gameplay Analysis Team for TFT, and you‚Äôre tasked with finding an appropriate nerf. You‚Äôve determined that the main issue is that Zoe casts too frequently, allowing her to rack up extra bounces on her spell and overwhelm boards in seconds. What should you do?
- a\) Nerf her max mana.
- b\) Nerf her starting mana.
- c\) Nerf her attack speed.

In the existing system, option a\) is always incorrect. Even a nerf of 5 extra max mana can have drastic knock-on effects. We can do some dirty back-of-the-napkin math to verify this: if a unit that commonly built Shojin to solve their mana pool of 60 received a mana nerf to 65, they‚Äôd require an extra auto to reach max mana, effectively casting 25% slower. If you were to instead use attack speed (AS) as the lever, the roughly equivalent nerf to cast frequency would be a change from 0.75 -> 0.60. 

<div>
  <img src="/assets/zoe_5_mana_nerf.png" class="sm:w-5/6 mx-auto" alt="5 mana nerf Zoe comparisons">
</div>

> i‚Äôm honestly not sure why 0.60 AS is technically better, but i do know that it doesn‚Äôt get an extra cast unless the fight lasts 117 seconds.

I don‚Äôt think an explanation is necessary to show that this is a disproportionately large nerf for what feels like a small numbers change. The nerfs are smaller if the unit doesn‚Äôt build Shojin, but balance should probably be around the main existing case, not the nonoptimal edge case. With a threshold-centric mana system, mana changes are basically never allowed for caster units. This is the epitome of balance thrashing: a buff of -5 mana usually accomplishes literally nothing to anyone and a nerf of +5 mana is a fate worse than death. I wouldn‚Äôt wish such a nerf upon my worst enemy. (Maybe  a small wish on Lux.)

With the new banking system, the effect of a 5 mana nerf changes significantly!

</div>

> this graph might be the least clear of all time i‚Äôm sorry, you‚Äôll have to trust me on this one

The first cast will still be a good bit slower, but subsequent casts happen much sooner due to the banking system. It still sucks, but instead of a 25% nerf, it‚Äôs now closer to a 10% nerf on cast frequency. Much less punishing.

As players, you want the devs to have as easy of a job as possible to make the game fun. As devs, your job gets marginally easier the more useful tools you have at your disposal. It might still be a sensitive lever, but that‚Äôs better than a graceless hammer. 
## Unit UI additions: Damage Amp and Durability
Since time immemorial (a little more than five years ago), TFT has had two widely used but untrackable stats: percent damage multiplier (now called ‚Äúdamage amp‚Äù) and percent damage reduction (now called ‚Äúdurability‚Äù). Durability was introduced first with traits and later on with items, with it currently available on Redemption and Steadfast Heart. Damage amp has been available everywhere, though: items like Deathcap, traits like Sniper, and augments like Ascension all tag on this untrackable stat. This has posed a clarity issue in two parts, both of which I will touch on.
### Estimating board strength
During combat, players might expect to be able to calculate damage, but with these % damage changes being invisible on the stats sheet, even giving a ballpark estimate ended up being very difficult. Obviously, it‚Äôs unreasonable to assume that any players are actually doing the damage calculations in their head, especially given how complicated armor and magic resistance formulas are, but it‚Äôs nice to pretend.

What isn‚Äôt playing pretend is the practice of estimating board strength. The board strength skill test is one of the hardest parts about playing the game: knowing when you should roll or level based on your board strength is a central decision that every player makes consciously (or not) throughout every game. Damage amp and durability, as invisible but still very impactful stats, makes this task significantly harder. Sure, you might have a rough idea that the enemy Amumu with 2 Porcelain, 4 Warden, Redemption, and Steadfast Heart is quite tanky, but do you know intuitively that the Amumu is taking roughly 64-85% less damage (depending on how the math is done) with all the above fully active? I‚Äôd hazard that you don‚Äôt, and most players don‚Äôt either. The clarity around damage dealable and damage takeable is important to a player‚Äôs ability to solve this problem correctly. If the damage system has a significant portion of its parameters hidden from view, this problem becomes much harder than it should be.
### Multiplicative Scaling in Itemization
Three years ago, TFT Pro Mismatched Socks posted the following video on [YouTube about itemization and multiplicative scaling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8UoiWoo_o0). For those who can‚Äôt watch, the video talks about how to maximize offensive outputs using a mixture of AD/AP, crit, attack speed, and damage amp. It‚Äôs not an exaggeration to say that this was a paradigm-shifting revelation for me. Before, I used to think that one number big = good. Socks instead demonstrated that one number big < many number medium. 

$$
Postmitigation Damage=(\frac{100}{100+Resistance} \cdot Durability) \cdot (DamageAmp)\\(DamageBase+CritChance \cdot (CritMod-1)\cdot DamageBase
$$
> fundamental theorem of damage?

It sounds a bit silly looking back, but it really did open my eyes to the math behind TFT for the first time. With a little math intuition and a calculator to verify the results, it becomes clear that offensive item optimization centers around maximizing damage stats as evenly as possible while synergizing with your units strongest outputs. This isn‚Äôt obvious when one of the main multipliers of the damage equation is hidden! If you already knew about this concept, then the reveal of damage amp doesn‚Äôt change how you itemize. However, without the knowledge of how damage amp was tracked and calculated, coming to this conclusion requires two jumps in logic, one of which is mostly hidden from the player. It‚Äôs simply a net good to reveal this information to players such that they can make informed decisions to their advantage.
## Postface
When I hold design opinions about TFT, I‚Äôve found that being myself is not always the correct answer. I am a (newly) GM peak player who greeds for items and focuses on breadth of knowledge over depth when it comes to climbing. I might be in the target audience for TFT, but I am certainly not the player profile towards which the devs should cater the game. I think it‚Äôs generally more important to consider the broader audience: players who think TFT is neat, might want to improve, but find the game‚Äôs numerous systems opaque and difficult to learn. To this end, I think TFT is a better game overall if more of the game‚Äôs systems are visible and intuitive. I wrote this piece because I think these are both unequivocally good changes, and I think it‚Äôs good to express admiration for when good changes are made. Not all yapping has to be negative. Anyways, thanks for reading!

# Manga Recommendations

I’ve been an avid reader of manga for a while now. If a romcom was published within the past five years, there’s a coin toss’s chance that I’ve given it a glance. I don’t have a comprehensive list of the things I’ve read. I also don’t really review stuff in that sort of way, but I do keep a rough track of how much I enjoyed them.

## All-Timers

- Spirit Circle
- You and I are Polar Opposites
- Goodbye, Eri
- Zense Coupling
- See You in My 19th Life

## Recently on the Radar

- Houkago Kitaku Biyori
- Ogami Tsumiki to Kinichijou
- My Wife is from a Thousand Years Ago
- Akane-banashi
- Blue Box

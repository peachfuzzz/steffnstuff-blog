Hey there, I’m Stephen Wu. I’m currently a student at NYU with concentrations in finance and data science/computing and a minor in creative writing. My experiences primarily lie in data science, with a focus on machine learning research for medicine and health. Currently, I'm an intern doing biostatistics research at Mayo Clinic and I'm involved with game design for an upcoming health and mindfulness game.
